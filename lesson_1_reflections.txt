How did diff help you... 
i didnt have to search the file by myself. it was marked.

how could having easy access to the entire history 	of a file make oyu a more efficient programmer in the long term? 
- you can see your changes. and your are able to easily make backsteps to previous versions or some parts of them. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
- when you choose manually, every commit is for a choosen change. when you make manualle you verlieren very easy the Ã¼bersicht. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- because there is a differences between the files that are for version control systems and files that are for google Docs. files for version control system have some realtions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something? easier to make backsteps 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
make own commits 

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- to work with version control software
